In this project, I used a dataset called "Heroes of Pymoli" to analyze, find trends and generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights like the following:

**Total Player Count
**Total Purchasing Analysis of players
**Gender Demographics
**Purchasing Analysis by Age
**Age Demographics
**Top Spenders
**Most Popular Items
**Most Profitable Items

Process Employed - 

1. Reading the CSV in to a dataframe
2. Performing aggregate functions like sum,mean.
3. Bining data for finding purchasing analysis by age
4. Using loc,iloc functions to select a subset of the dataframe for analysis
5. Using Groupby function
